Q1: What is the difference between antisymmetry and asymmetry?

Q2: What is transitive closure on R?





A1: Antisymmetry means R (A, B) & R (B, A) can only hold when A == B.
    Asymmetric is the same except for the property that the relation can not be reflexive.
    Simply put, a relation is asymmetric when it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive.

A2: The smallest transitive relation that contains R.
